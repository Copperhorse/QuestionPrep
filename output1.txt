The optimal batch size depends on the specific dataset and hardware resources. Memory limited setups are applicable in scenarios where the available memory is constrained, such as on mobile devices or embedded systems. The trade-offs include computational efficiency and model accuracy. Key factors influencing the optimal batch size include the dataset size, hardware capabilities, and the specific contrastive loss function."]}}
